### Hi there 👋 I'm Aliff.

After finishing my degree, I learned web developement as I realized my interest is in web developement . I just finished my course on NodeJS, MongoDB and Express! Now I'm improving my skills in MERN stack. Although a long way to go and so much to learn as someone who is new to this industry, learning something new everytime.
